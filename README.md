# Hi! I am Florian 👋

Currently split between France 🇫🇷 and Canada 🇨🇦 for a dual-degree program (MSc in Computer Science & MEng in AI and Data Science). I spend most of my time exploring **Agentic AI** and **Computer Vision**, specifically for healthcare and industrial use cases.

I'm a big believer in learning by building. I use my free time to ship small, educational projects to test new tools and improve my skills. Most of them are right here on my GitHub.

Currently, I'm also stepping outside the terminal to develop a video game on my own using Godot. It’s a challenge that involves everything from narrative writing to mastering graphic design—learning how to build an experience from the ground up.

## Tech I use 
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++ (17+), R, SQL, Java.
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch (CUDA), Scikit-learn, OpenCV.
- **Agentic AI:** CrewAI, LangChain, Pydantic, Ollama.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL.
- **Game dev**: Godot

## Latest Project: [Polrate](https://github.com/2521o/Polrate)
I built this to experiment with **multi-agent systems**. The goal was to summarize and fact-check YouTube debate transcripts by orchestrating specialized agents. It uses CrewAI to manage the workflow and Ollama to run the LLMs locally.

* **Key Challenge:** Designing an effective coordination logic between the "Summarizer" and the "Fact-checker" agents.
* **Stack:** Python, CrewAI, Ollama.
