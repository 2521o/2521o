# Hi! I am Florian 👋

Currently split between France 🇫🇷 and Canada 🇨🇦 for a dual-degree program (MSc in Computer Science & MEng in AI and Data Science). I spend most of my time exploring **Agentic AI** and **Computer Vision**, specifically for healthcare and industrial use cases.

I'm a big believer in learning by building. I use my free time to ship small, educational projects to test new tools and improve my skills. Most of them are right here on my GitHub.

## Tech I use 
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++ (17+), R, SQL, Java.
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch (CUDA), Scikit-learn, OpenCV.
- **Agentic AI:** CrewAI, LangChain, Pydantic, Ollama.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL.

## Latest Project: [Polrate](https://github.com/2521o/Polrate)
I built this to experiment with **multi-agent systems**. The goal was to summarize and fact-check YouTube debate transcripts by orchestrating specialized agents. It uses CrewAI to manage the workflow and Ollama to run the LLMs locally.

* **Key Challenge:** Designing an effective coordination logic between the "Summarizer" and the "Fact-checker" agents.
* **Stack:** Python, CrewAI, Ollama.
